=head1 DESCRIPTION

Finance::QIF is a module for working with QIF (Quicken Interchange
Format) files in Perl.  This module reads QIF data records from a file
passing each successive record to the caller for processing.  This
module also has the capability of writing QIF records to a file.

The QIF file format typically consists of a header containing a record
or transaction type, followed by associated data records.  Within a
file there may be multiple headers.  Headers are usually followed by
data records, however data is not required to always follow a header.

A hash reference is returned for each record read from a file.  The
hash will have a "header" value which contains the header type that
was read along with all supported values found for that record.  If a
value is not specified in the data file, the value will not exist in
this hash.

No processing or validation is done on values found in files or data
structures to try and convert them into appropriate types and formats.
It is expected that users of this module or extensions to this module
will do any additional processing or validation as required.

ways to control how Quicken processes the QIF file.  They have no
impact on how this software operates and are ignored when found.

=back

Note: If this software finds unsupported record types or values in a
data file a warning will be generated containing information on what
unexpected value was found.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Creates a new instance of Finance::QIF.  Supports the following
initializing values.

  my $qif = Finance::QIF->new( file => "myfile", debug => 1 );

If the file is specified it will be opened on new.

=over

=item file

Specifies file to use for processing.  See L</file()> for details.

  my $in = Finance::QIF->new( file => "myfile" );
OR
  my $in = Finance::QIF->new( file => [ "myfile", "<:crlf" ] );

For output files, be sure to open the file in write mode.  For example:

  my $out = Finance::QIF->new( file => ">myfile" );

=item record_separator

Can be used to redefine the QIF record separator.  Default is $/.

  my $in = Finance::QIF->new( record_separator => "\012" );

Note: For MacOS X it will most likely be necessary to change this to
"\015".  Quicken on MacOS X generates files with "\015" as the separator
which is typical of Mac however the native perl in MacOS X is unix
based and uses the default unix separator which is "\012".  See
L</autodetect> for another option.

=item autodetect

Enable auto detection of the record separator based on the file
contents.  Default is "0".

  my $in = Finance::QIF->new( autodetect => 1 );

Perl uses $/ to define line separators for text files.  Perl sets this
value according to the OS perl is running on:

  Windows="\015\012"
  Mac="\015"
  Unix="\012"

In many cases you may find yourself with text files that do not match
the OS.  In these cases Finance::QIF by default will not process that
QIF file correctly. This feature is an attempt to help with the most
common cases of having the wrong text file for the OS Finance::QIF is
running on.

This feature depends on being able to seek to the end of the file and
reading the last 2 characters to determine the proper separator. If a
seek can not be performed or the last 2 characters are not a proper
separator the record_separator will default to $/ or the value passed
in. If a valid record_separator is found then it will be set according
to what was in the file.

This code requires a file use a consistent line separator. If you find
your self dealing with unusual files containing mixed separators you
need to first Normalize the file to a consistent separator.

Normalizing a text file to have a consistent line separator is done in
modules like  File::LocalizeNewlines or Template::Parser::LocalizeNewlines
so if you are having issues with trying to process poorly formated text
files look at preprocessing them with something like those before passing
on to Finance::QIF.

=item trim_white_space

Can be used to remove leading and trailing white space from values
returned. Default is "0".

  my $qif = Finance::QIF->new( trim_white_space => 1 );

=item debug

Can be used to output debug information.  Default is "0".

  my $qif = Finance::QIF->new( debug => 1 );

=back

=head2 file()

Specify file name and optionally additional parameters that will be
used to obtain a filehandle.  The argument can be a filename (SCALAR),
an ARRAY reference, or an ARRAY whose values must be valid arguments
for passing to IO::File->new.

  $qif->file( "myfile" );
 OR
  $qif->file( [ "myfile", "<:crlf" ] );
 OR
  $qif->file( "myfile", "<:crlf" );

For output files, be sure to open the file in write mode.

=head2 record_separator()

Returns the currently used record_separator.  This is used primarly in
situations where you open a QIF file with autodetect and then want to
write out a QIF file in the same format.

  my $in  = Finance::QIF->new( file => "input.qif", autodetect => 1 );
  my $out = Finance::QIF->new( file => ">write.qif",
                               record_separator => $in->record_separator );

=head2 open()

Open already specified file.

  $qif->open();

Open also supports the same arguments as L</file()>.

=head2 next()

For input files return the next record in the QIF file.

  my $record = $in->next();

Returns undef if no more records are available.

=head2 header()

For output files use to output the passed header for records that will
then be written with write.

  $out->header( "Type:Bank" );

See L<RECORD TYPES & VALUES> for list of possible record types that
can be passed.

=head2 write()

For output files use to output the passed record to the file.

  $out->write( $record );

=head2 reset()

Resets the filehandle so the records can be read again from the
beginning of the file.

  $qif->reset();

=head2 close()

Closes the open file.

  $qif->close();

=head1 EXAMPLES

Read an existing QIF file then write out to new QIF file.

  my $in  = Finance::QIF->new( file => "input.qif" );
  my $out = Finance::QIF->new( file => ">write.qif" );
  
  my $header = "";
  while ( my $record = $in->next() ) {
      if ( $header ne $record->{header} ) {
          $out->header( $record->{header} );
          $header = $record->{header};
      }
      $out->write($record);
  }
  
  $in->close();
  $out->close();
