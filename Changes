Revision history for Perl extension Finance::QIF.

3.01  Thu Apr 08 12:30:00 EDT 2010
	- Corrected documentation for Account and Type:Memorized
        - Updated code separators based on perlport "NEWLINES" recommendation
	- Use binmode in more compatible manner (older IO::File missing method)

3.00  Thu Jul 24 12:17:00 2008
	- Added support for Quicken 2006 new Memorized Investment fields
	- Added support for Quicken 2006 Price format
	- The changes for the Memorized investment created a conflict with
          naming to get things consistent and to hopefully avoid future
          issues some value names have changed. This is the reason for a 3.00.
          Old code may require modification this map will help in porting
	  Old Name                   New Name

	  memorized:transaction      memorized:type
	  memorized:amount           memorized:transaction
